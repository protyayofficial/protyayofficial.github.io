## Installation

1. Install Jekyll via their official instructions.

2. [Fork](https://github.com/lolipopshock/avalanche/fork) the avalanche repository, install dependencies, and start the jekyll server:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/avalanche.git && cd avalanche
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

## Create a new blog post 

1. Create a (markdown) file in the `_post` folder:
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll post <title-to-your-post>
    ```
    It will automatically create the file in the `YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md` format. 
2. Edit the content in `YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md`, just like what you do in any other markdown files. 
    - The markdown files contains some metadata, which is known as the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).
    - Math symbols and equations are also supprted, e.g., 
        ```latex
        $$
        \frac{\partial (\rho u_{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial[\rho u_{i}u_{j}]}{\partial x_{j}} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}} + \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_{j}} + \rho f_{i}
        $$
        ```
        will render 
        
        $$
        \frac{\partial (\rho u_{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial[\rho u_{i}u_{j}]}{\partial x_{j}} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x_{i}} + \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_{j}} + \rho f_{i} 
        $$

## Publish the website via Github Pages 

1. Test the changes locally and ensure it works properly

2. Commit the changes and push them to Github
    - A github workflow will run and generate website in a separate branch `gh-pages` on Github  

3. Configure the Github page settings:![Github Page Publish Setting]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/gh-publish.png)
    1. Go to your github repo website `https://github.com/<your-github-username>/avalanche`, and open the setting:
    2. Go to the `Pages` page on the left panel
    3. Change to use `gh-pages` branch to publish the website 

4. Wait for a while and the site should be ready via `<your-github-username>.github.io/avalanche`

## Optional

1. You can [rename your Github repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/renaming-a-repository) from `avalanche` to `<your-github-username>.github.io` on Github, and the site will be published at `<your-github-username>.github.io/` instead.
